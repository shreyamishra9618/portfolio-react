### Description
This Website, acts as an introduction to my coding experience, a display of my coding portfolio, and listing of contact information. The webpage utilizes semantic React to aesthetically generate a landing page, a section describing me, a section for my portfolio, and a section for contact information. Flexbox and relative positioning were used to generate the layout. The page is responsive to different screen sizes.
